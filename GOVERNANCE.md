# CBZ-0 governance

Effective 2026-10-29, by the owner's **MASTER DIRECTIVE — CRYSTALLINE
BASELINE PROTOCOL**. This is the current operational authority throughout
the federation. Earlier owner mandates, freezes, family-review gates,
approval forms and custody ceremonies are historical where they conflict.
Platform permissions and denials remain binding. Historical mathematical
statements, test failures, authorship and verification outcomes are facts;
this governance change does not rewrite them.

## Mission and authority

The sole mission is Clean Baseline Zero (CBZ-0), not additional research.
Agents may build, repair, replace, integrate, archive or remove operational
material needed for that mission. No owner question, selection, approval,
external review quorum or waiting period is required. Resolve ambiguity
conservatively for mathematical rigor and aggressively for consolidation.
Coordinate independent tasks without blocking on a peer's approval.

Priority: Layer A; CBZ-0; reduced maintenance; cold-start legibility;
auditor soundness; speed; aesthetics. Select work by closure, unblocking
and maintenance benefit, less effort and ten times the rigor risk. On
conflicts preserve the mathematically stronger valid result; prefer the
simpler operational structure; combine compatible work. Archive a genuinely
incompatible alternative with its exact boundary and evidence.

## Layer A: immutable

1. No logical placeholders or stubbed theorems presented as closed.
2. No unverified axiom injection.
3. No floating-point certification of mathematical bounds: exact rational
   or justified interval/real reasoning only.
4. Never loosen a mathematical bound to pass a check.
5. Preserve failing tests; repair or isolate them with a written boundary.
   Consolidation requires evidence of redundancy under a stricter proof.
6. Mark conclusions relying on unsatisfiable hypotheses in the proof index.
7. Every status statement must describe observed source/build/audit state.
8. Certifying tools require their own tests, including adverse mutations;
   they must not skip cases silently or manufacture a passing result.

Kernel verification establishes only its exact formal statement and
declared axiom dependencies. Prose review, finite algebra checks, hashes,
merges and engineering CI cannot establish kernel closure or a stronger
mathematical interpretation.

## Layer B: operational statutes

- **B-001 (2026-10-29):** Canonical federation authority is this file;
  `STATUS.md` is the complete cold-start entry. `PROOF_INDEX.md` records
  exact CLOSED/kernel evidence or QUARANTINED boundaries. `TOOLING.md`
  registers mission tools; `BASELINE.md` binds snapshots, commits and gates.
  Rationale: replace dispersed procedural approval chains with reproducible
  evidence. Scope: all in-scope repositories.
- **B-002 (2026-10-29):** Decisions are append-only in `DECISIONS.md`.
  Date, phase, layer, action, rationale, reversibility and evidence are
  required. Discovery evidence is timestamped and source-bound; a changing
  federation is not represented as an atomic observation.
- **B-003 (2026-10-29):** Root owns shared canonical files and integration;
  delegated discovery writes only its assigned evidence directory. Agents
  may make autonomous bounded decisions and finish without peer approval.
  Rationale: avoid concurrent overwrite while preserving parallel work.
- **B-004 (2026-10-29):** Snapshot before recoverable/destructive operations;
  one extra verification cycle before irreversible published history work.
  No silent deletion. Preserve removed material in a documented tag,
  recoverable archive or bundle. No history rewrite is needed merely for
  aesthetic cleanup.
- **B-005 (2026-10-29):** A gate is PASS only after its command ran and its
  output and exit were observed at the recorded source. Source-only checks
  and historical hosted receipts must not substitute for fresh execution.
  Final CBZ gates must all be observed in one final run.
- **B-006 (2026-10-29):** An auditor certifies only the properties and
  domain its implementation and adverse tests establish. Explicitly
  report unsupported claims or cases; never call them proven by a lexical
  scan. Quarantine classifications do not erase detected hazards.

## Quarantine

Every proof quarantine records an ID, title, exact source location, Layer A
status, exact proven/unproven boundary, mathematical blocking reason,
attempts, resumption cost, isolation, owner `none` and maintenance `zero`.
Closed formal code must not import a quarantined logical dependency.
Quarantine is dormant until deliberately reopened. No new research is
authorized merely because a quarantined question exists.

## Execution and termination

Discover all repositories/refs/PRs/proofs/CI/admin material and tool gaps;
write the inventory. Finish or quarantine obligations, integrate compatible
work and archive obsolete ceremony. Run G0 through G11; repair discrepancies
at source. Publish the canonical handoff and perform a fresh-clone test
using `STATUS.md` alone. Each iteration must make a measurable change;
after two no-op iterations diagnose and change strategy.

Do not declare CBZ-0 until all twelve owner criteria are observed together:
clean Git, no dangling deliveries, all proofs closed/quarantined, no Layer A
violations, all regressions green, Lean/kernel/axioms green, mutation target
met, pins consistent, tools documented/verified, canonical surfaces truthful,
cold-start reproducibility and complete decisions/no administrative residue.
A resource-limited terminal state must explicitly be a Partial Baseline,
with precise isolated residue and unmet criteria; it must never be called
CBZ-0.

## Tool registry

No new certifying tool has yet been admitted by this mission. Existing tools
are being inventoried against their actual tests and execution coverage.
Mission tools must be finished, documented with exact usage and verification,
and registered here and in `TOOLING.md` before final admission. Tools are a
means to closure, never a reason to open a general infrastructure project.

### Historical bounded replay helper and delivery workflow

The two evidence packages contain byte-identical historical copies of
`replay_tool.py`, `test_replay_tool.py`, `run_mutations.py`, and
`run_lean_selftest.py`. They generate and check a bounded Lean replay and
exercise finite controls; they are not a federation-wide Layer A auditor.
The original manifests, historical reports and metadata are immutable evidence.
The delivered source is restored from composite source commit
`82d9e480a51b946b3e74525ccf32139129d37d28`. Historical Python and Lean v3
reports are distinct from a fresh current-head run. The v3 reports identify
the delivered Lean self-test source; the separate final-normal report identifies
a different self-test source and must not be attributed to these bytes.

The historical mutation grader accepts a named failure plus an unrelated
assertion or another error, and a zero-test baseline; its Python loader may
read pre-existing bytecode even under `-B`. The Lean self-test's textual
diagnostics have similarly limited binding. These are source-review findings
with executable counterexample tests provided, not a claim that those tests
have passed at the current head. The helper is not admitted as a sound G0
certifier. See `TOOLING.md` for commands and scope. The hosted workflow uses a
fresh private bytecode prefix for historical runs and preserves raw outputs;
this reduces cache exposure on a trusted runner but does not fix the tool.
