This is a conditional structural theorem with explicit field-admission interfaces.
The particular [periodized Gaussian adapter](../periodized_gaussian_h0/PROOF.md)

## 1. Structural claim and falsifiable interface table

A cubic height gap alone does not determine a lifetime density exponent.
For a regular fold, the actual two-height/two-gradient contact density,
spatial volume and two Hessian determinants must also have their indicated
orders. When those orders combine to give `r dr`, the cubic pushforward gives
the lifetime exponent `-1/3`. This dimensional cancellation is proved here.
Verifying that a particular field has those orders, the needed domination,
and the actual elder selection remains a substantive admission task.

Let X be a connected compact smooth Riemannian manifold without boundary,
of dimension d>=1 and volume V_X. Samples of F are smooth real functions.
Use superlevel H0, with increasing filtration parameter -c for {F>=c},
over any fixed coefficient field. Count finite elder bars, excluding the one
essential class. A finite bar is born at a maximum M and dies at a merging
critical point S of Morse index d-1 for F. Its lifetime is

    ell=F(M)-F(S)>0.

The following five interfaces are sufficient. They are conditions on the
actual field, its actual conditional laws and the actual H0 selector. They
are not substitutes for one another.

| Interface | Exact consumed contract | A direct refusal or falsifier |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COUNT | F is unconditionally Morse with distinct critical values almost surely; an everywhere Borel elder selector sigma counts each finite H0 bar once. The all-nonnegative-Borel ordered critical-pair formula and two-height disintegration in Section 2 hold for specified density and conditional-law versions. | Atomic height laws, a selector counting candidates instead of bars, a determinant counted twice, or failure of once-counting. |
| CONTACT | For literal rows/targets in Section 3, pi_r(v_r) converges to pi_0(v_0), and E_Qr[W_r/r^2] converges to z_0=36k^2 E_Q0[(det A)^2 1(A<0)] for each fixed (x,u,b,k), k>0. These quantities are finite. | Contact rank collapse, a singular contact density, a different determinant order, or zero negative-cone weight. |
| SELECT | For those same specified fibers, E_Qr[(W_r/r^2)(1-sigma)] tends to zero. No all-target finite-r conditional genericity is inferred from unconditional genericity. | Local extra critical points, nonisolated limit contact, a younger competing branch, or a global collision defeating the elder event. |
| ENVELOPE | A common r_0>0 and nonnegative H(x,u,b,k) satisfy 12 pi_r(v_r) E_Qr[W_r/r^2]<=H for 0<r<=r_0, and integral k^(-2/3) H over (x,u,b,k) is finite. | Small-amplitude or high-mark tails, loss of uniform covariance control, or a nonintegrable k->0 boundary. |
| FAR | The complement integral in the specified kernel representative (4) is a finite, locally integrable Borel lifetime density nu_far, with ell^(1/3) nu_far(ell)->0. A uniform O(1) far candidate bound is sufficient. | A remote small-lifetime contribution of comparable or larger order. |

All integrals in the table use dvol(x), ordinary sphere area d sigma_x(u),
db and dk. In d=1 sphere area means counting measure on S^0={-1,+1}.
The envelope may depend on x and direction; its integral is over the unit
tangent bundle SX. For a family of models, a common envelope is an additional
uniformity requirement, not a consequence of the individual limits.

The theorem also requires the resulting contact coefficient C in Section 6
to be strictly positive. If C=0, the proof gives a zero scaled limit, not a
positive `-1/3` asymptotic. Finite C follows from the stated envelope.

**Conditional structural theorem.** Under COUNT, CONTACT, SELECT, ENVELOPE
and FAR, the expected finite-bar measure per volume has a particular finite
nonnegative Borel density representative nu_bar on ell>0 satisfying

    nu_bar(ell) ~ C ell^(-1/3),                 ell down to 0,
    E N_bar((0,t])/V_X ~ (3/2) C t^(2/3),       t down to 0.        (1)

Its coefficient is the actual contact functional (14) below. Under the
additional centered-Gaussian parity contract it simplifies to (19).
The exponent is independent of d once these interfaces hold. It is not an
unconditional dimension-independent admission result. The coefficient depends
on the field law and local geometry. No continuity of the selected density,
point-process law or quantitative asymptotic window is asserted.

## 2. Counting and the measurable elder selector

For distinct p,q write

    O_(p,q)=(F(p),grad F(p),F(q),grad F(q)),
    Delta_(p,q)=|det Hess F(p) det Hess F(q)|,
    tau_(p,q)=1{Hess F(p)<0} 1{Hess F(q) has index d-1},
    W_(p,q)=Delta_(p,q) tau_(p,q).                           (2)

The index indicator is restricted to nonsingular Hessians. A change on a
singular Hessian has no effect because its determinant is zero. Densities
of gradients use orthonormal-coordinate Euclidean volume in the tangent
spaces. Thus rotations of the local frames have absolute determinant one.

COUNT's all-Borel formula means, initially as an extended nonnegative
integral, that for every nonnegative Borel mark w on the field and pair,

    E sum_(p!=q,grad F(p)=grad F(q)=0) w(p,q,F)
      =integral_(p!=q) p_(grad F(p),grad F(q))(0)
                           E[Delta_(p,q) w | both gradients=0]
                           dvol(p) dvol(q).                (3)

Applying (3) to `w=tau sigma 1{F(p)-F(q) in I}` gives W sigma. Delta
appears exactly once. Disintegrating the two heights with actual density
p_O and an actual regular conditional field kernel Q^p,q_(b,s) gives

    K_sel(p,q,b,s)=p_O(b,0,s,0) E_Q[W_(p,q) sigma(p,q,F)],
    nu_bar(ell)=V_X^(-1) integral_(p!=q) integral_R
                       K_sel(p,q,b,b-ell) db dvol(p) dvol(q).   (4)

Joint Borel versions of p_O and Q are part of COUNT. They are explicitly
available through Gaussian coefficient projection in Section 8. Tonelli
proves (4) as a density identity; this does not differentiate a cumulative
asymptotic. A conditional kernel can be singular in unused second-jet
coordinates. Full two-site Hessian rank is not required.

The field law is a Borel law on smooth functions. All contact density and
conditional-law versions below are induced from these same specified
COUNT versions by the invertible observation transform, rather than chosen
independently on exceptional fibers. FAR likewise refers to the complement
of (4) itself. This fixes the representative for the pointwise conclusion.

Here is a dimension-independent Borel selector construction. Fix a countable
dense subset D of X and a countable basis of relatively small geodesic balls
with compact closures. Choose radii below a common convexity radius, so the
balls are path connected. For an open superlevel {f>lambda}, p and z lie
in the same path component exactly when there is a finite chain of basis
balls from p to z, consecutive balls intersect, and

    min_(closure B_i) f > lambda for each ball in the chain.

A compact path is covered by such balls; conversely a chain supplies a
path. Each minimum is continuous in f in the uniform norm. The chain
relation is Borel in (f,p,z,lambda), by its countable description. Put

    D_f(p)=sup{lambda in Q: lambda<f(p),
         exists z in D with f(z)>f(p) connected to p in {f>lambda}}, (5)

with empty supremum -infinity. This is jointly Borel. The dense-point
condition is equivalent to reaching any point of greater height. Hence
(5) is intrinsic and invariant under any isometry transporting the field.

On the open set G of Morse functions with distinct critical values, define
sigma to be one exactly when p,q are critical, p is a maximum, q has index
d-1, D_f(p) is finite and

    D_f(p)=f(q)<f(p);

set it to zero outside G. Openness of G follows from the finitely many
implicit critical branches and a compact gradient floor away from them;
critical-height inequalities persist. Thus sigma is everywhere Borel.

For clarity, the once-counting here is an actual H0 fact. Descending through
distinct Morse levels, a maximum creates a component. A critical point of
index d-1 for f attaches a 1-handle for -f: its two upper local sectors
either merge two components or join the same component, in which case H0
does not change. A higher-index handle for -f has connected attaching set
and cannot merge distinct components. At a merger retain the higher-birth
label and kill the lower label. This is elementary H0 linear algebra: the
two component generators have the same image after the merger and their
difference supplies the killed generator. Induction gives the finite elder
intervals. Critical-free compact bands preserve component inclusion by the
gradient flow. These are the classical Morse handle/level-band facts,
imported with their specified scope in ET; they are not proved as a new
general Morse theorem here.

The rational supremum in (5) is the exact merger height: open superlevels
connect below that level, so a supremum recovers the closed critical level.
The unique global maximum has D_f=-infinity and yields the essential class.
Every other maximum dies at exactly one merging index-(d-1) point, and a
merging 1-handle kills exactly one label. Thus every finite bar contributes
one ordered maximum/merger pair, with no factor 1/2. For d=1 a minimum of f
is precisely the index-0 merger point; on a connected closed 1-manifold
(a circle) the same component argument applies. It is not an assertion
of any particular one-dimensional random-field genericity result.

## 3. Literal contact rows and their exact Jacobian

Fix x in X and a unit u in T_x X. Let v_1,...,v_(d-1) be a local
orthonormal basis of u-perp. For sufficiently small r>0 let

    M=exp_x(-r u/2), S=exp_x(r u/2).

Use the frame obtained by parallel transporting u,v_i along this geodesic.
Write h_M=F(M), h_S=F(S), g_uM,g_uS for the axial gradients, and
g_iM,g_iS for the transverse gradient coordinates. Reorder O as

    (h_M,h_S,g_uM,g_uS,(g_iM,g_iS)_(i=1,...,d-1)).

This is just a permutation of the original observations. Define U_r by

    (h_M+h_S)/2,
    (h_S-h_M)/r,
    (g_uS-g_uM)/r,
    (6/r^2)[g_uM+g_uS-2(h_S-h_M)/r],
    ((g_iM+g_iS)/2,(g_iS-g_iM)/r)_(i=1,...,d-1).           (6)

For heights b,b-k r^3 and zero gradients, k>0, the exact target is

    v_r=(b-k r^3/2,-k r^2,0,12k,(0,0)_(i=1,...,d-1)).     (7)

There are 2d+2 rows. The first four transformation rows have matrix

    [  1/2       1/2         0        0    ]
    [ -1/r       1/r         0        0    ]
    [   0         0        -1/r      1/r   ]
    [ 12/r^3   -12/r^3      6/r^2    6/r^2 ].

The two diagonal 2-by-2 blocks have determinants 1/r and -12/r^3.
The last row's height entries do not change this block-triangular
determinant. Each transverse pair has determinant 1/r. Therefore

    |det(O -> U_r)|=12 r^(-(d+3)),
    p_O(b,0,b-k r^3,0)=12 r^(-(d+3)) pi_r(v_r).            (8)

This identity is exact on a manifold as well, for the specified parallel
orthonormal gradient coordinates. It is a finite-dimensional linear
observation transform, not a spatial-coordinate Jacobian.

In the contact limit the rows are, with the order in (6),

    U_0=(F,F_u,F_uu,F_uuu,(F_vi,F_uvi)_(i=1,...,d-1)),
    v_0=(b,0,0,12k,(0,0)_(i=1,...,d-1)).                 (9)

Directional derivatives are covariant derivatives along the geodesic and
parallel frame. In particular F_uu=Hess F(u,u), F_uvi=Hess F(u,v_i),
and F_uuu is the derivative of Hess F(u,u) along that geodesic. A local
normal-coordinate third derivative agrees with this at the contact,
since grad F=0 there. Finite-r difference rows converge to (9) for a C4
field. Convergence of random rows by itself does not prove convergence
of their densities or conditional laws; CONTACT demands those facts.

Different bases of u-perp act orthogonally on the transverse rows. Densities
with respect to their Euclidean volume, the transverse determinant and the
cone A<0 are invariant. One uses local frame charts (or a Borel partition),
not an assumed global section of the perpendicular frame bundle.

## 4. Determinant order and a sufficient elder-transfer adapter

Let A_i denote the physical transverse Hessian block at i=M,S in the
parallel frame. Under the exact pins, the physical Hessians have the form

    H_i=[ r alpha_i   r beta_i^T ]
        [ r beta_i        A_i   ].                       (10)

Zero endpoint gradients make the geodesic average of every axial Hessian
column entry zero. The fundamental theorem of calculus bounds alpha_i
and beta_i by a constant times a C3 norm. Under an actual C4 contact
coupling they satisfy

    alpha_M -> -6k, alpha_S -> 6k,
    beta_M,beta_S bounded, A_M,A_S -> A_0.

For example the first limit follows from integrating F_uu along the
geodesic, whose average is zero, and whose derivative tends to F_uuu=12k.
No conditional covariance of a pinned coordinate is asserted positive.

The determinant is a polynomial identity, so no inverse A is needed:

    det H_i/r=alpha_i det A_i-r beta_i^T adj(A_i) beta_i.   (11)

For d=1 use det A=1 and omit the second term. The correct inertia
congruence uses diag(r^(-1/2),I), giving the block matrix with alpha_i,
sqrt(r) beta_i and A_i. If A_0 is negative definite, the left Hessian
is negative definite and the right Hessian has index d-1 for small r.
If A_0 is nonsingular and is not negative definite, the maximum condition
fails for small r. If A_0 is singular, the limit of det H_i/r is zero
and the determinant product kills any type ambiguity. Consequently,

    V_r:=W_r/r^2 -> V_0:=36k^2 (det A_0)^2 1{A_0<0}.     (12)

This pointwise weighted limit needs no boundary-null theorem for A_0.
Uniform integrability still has to be proved to pass to expectations.
The merger type must be the inertia index d-1. A negative determinant
alone is the correct saddle test only in d=2; in d=3 the intended
one-positive/two-negative saddle has a positive determinant.

Here is a deterministic sufficient condition for SELECT, proved in every
dimension; it is not a verification that an unspecific random law meets it.
Suppose smooth f_j->f_0 in global C4, r_j->0, x_j,u_j and their local
frames converge, b_j->b and k_j->k>0. Suppose the exact pins (7) hold.
At the limiting point suppose the contact rows are (9), A_0<0, and the
critical set of f_0 is finite; every other critical point is Morse, with
distinct critical values different from b.

In moving normal coordinates write g_j(s,t), t in R^(d-1). At contact
g_0,t=0, g_0,st=0, g_0,tt=A_0<0. On a fixed small cylinder
[-delta,delta] times B_tau, eventually g_j,tt<=-a I. The implicit
transverse ridge h_0(s) has h_0(0)=h_0'(0)=0. Shrink delta so
|h_0(s)|<tau/4. A uniform implicit-function argument in this fixed
cylinder gives a ridge h_j(s), |h_j|<tau/2, converging in C3.
Strict concavity makes it the unique transverse critical point for
each s in B_tau. Existence follows near h_0 on the compact s interval;
negative definiteness forbids a second root anywhere in that convex ball.

Put phi_j(s)=g_j(s,h_j(s)). Its third derivative converges uniformly.
The contact data give phi_0'=phi_0''=0 at zero and phi_0'''(0)=12k:
terms containing h_0'(0) or g_0,st vanish. Shrink the cylinder until
phi_j'''>=c>0. The exact critical pins make h_j(+-r_j/2)=0 and
phi_j'(+-r_j/2)=0. Thus phi_j' is strictly convex, has exactly these
two zeros, is negative between them, and is positive outside them.
Its derivatives at the left and right zeros are respectively negative
and positive. The Hessian Schur pivot is phi_j'' and the transverse
block is negative definite, giving the required maximum/index-(d-1)
types and no additional local critical points.

The limit ridge is strictly increasing near zero except at zero;
phi_0(-delta)<b<phi_0(delta/2). All other critical branches of f_0
persist by their nonsingular Hessians. A compact gradient floor on the
remainder rules out new critical points. Their limiting heights have
a positive distance from b and from one another. Hence f_j is globally
Morse with distinct critical values eventually. This conclusion uses
the stated contact-global genericity premise, not just local covariance.

Consider the left cylinder [-delta,r_j/2] times closed B_tau. Its left
boundary is below b_j by a fixed gap; its right boundary has height at
most phi_j(r_j/2)=d_j=b_j-k_j r_j^3. Since |h_j|<tau/2, strict
concavity gives side heights at most b_j-a tau^2/8. Eventually the
left and side boundaries are strictly below d_j. At d_j<c<b_j,
the closed superlevel in this cylinder is connected: its axial
projection is an interval containing M_j, each transverse fiber is
convex and contains its ridge point, and the ridge segment stays above c.
It misses the cylinder boundary, so it is an actual global component.
There is no exterior connection before d_j, and it is born at M_j.

The positive ridge past S_j reaches a fixed limiting point of height>b;
its perturbed height exceeds b_j. Its component is older. At d_j the
ridge from M_j through S_j to that point lies in the closed superlevel.
Only S_j is at that critical level. Its upper sectors therefore merge
the newborn component with an older component. The H0 elder rule gives
exactly the pair (M_j,S_j), of lifetime k_j r_j^3.

For d=1 there are no transverse variables or side boundary. The same
left interval, right cut and older positive ridge prove the deterministic
statement on a circle. This is a separate topological argument; no d=2
conditional-global genericity theorem is silently used in dimension one.

For a random-law adapter, suppose the specified Q_r and Q_0 can be
coupled with global C4 convergence, exact pins and an integrable dominating
variable for V_r at each fixed mark. Suppose the preceding contact-global
genericity holds Q_0-almost surely on V_0>0. Then sigma is eventually one
on V_0>0. On V_0=0, V_r(1-sigma)->0 regardless of the selector.
Dominated convergence proves E[V_r(1-sigma)]->0 and E[V_r]->E[V_0].
Uniform integrability with convergence in probability is an alternative
to one dominating variable. This supplies CONTACT's weight limit and
SELECT. It supplies neither a common physical chart radius nor a
simultaneous samplewise event over all marks and frames.

With continuous varying-parameter couplings, common moment domination and
contact genericity at every fixed limiting parameter, a compact-mark
sequence argument supplies uniform convergence of the unnormalized weighted
failure E[V_r(1-sigma)] to zero on compact birth/gap windows with k bounded
away from zero. A uniform normalized Q_r^W(sigma=1)->1 additionally requires
a continuous, strictly positive z_0 on that compact window, hence a positive
minimum. Neither uniform statement follows from pointwise convergence alone.
The theorem below needs only pointwise convergence followed by all-mark
domination.

## 5. The geometric measure factor on a manifold

Choose r_0 below a common short-geodesic scale. The midpoint map

    Psi(x,h)=(exp_x(-h/2),exp_x(h/2))

is a smooth diffeomorphism from a neighborhood of the zero section of TX
onto the corresponding neighborhood of the diagonal in X times X.
The inverse is the unique short geodesic's midpoint and oriented tangent
separation. With the natural base/fiber volume its Jacobian is a positive
smooth function J(x,h). At h=0 its derivative is

    (a,b) -> (a-b/2,a+b/2),

whose absolute determinant is one. Hence J(x,0)=1. Swapping the pair
is h->-h and preserves both volume measures, so J is even in h.
Smoothness and compactness give J(x,r u)=1+O(r^2) uniformly in x,u,
and a common finite bound for small r. In particular

    dvol(M) dvol(S)
       =J(x,r u) dvol(x) r^(d-1) dr d sigma_x(u).          (13)

The tangent-fiber polar factor r^(d-1) is exact. The midpoint metric
Jacobian J is generally not exactly one at finite r. Curvature therefore
enters finite-r formulas, but its leading factor in this contact band is
one. No global Euclidean spatial-coordinate formula is asserted.

## 6. Proof of the structural theorem and the dimensional cancellation

Write z_0(b,k,x,u)=E_Q0 V_0 and define the selected amplitude directly by

    B_r(b,k,x,u)=12 pi_r(v_r) E_Qr[V_r sigma].

One never needs a global inverse of E V_r. Normalized Q_r^W is useful
only where that expectation is positive; the product here is defined
even when it vanishes. CONTACT and SELECT give
B_r->12 pi_0(v_0) z_0 at every fixed mark and direction. Also 0<=B_r<=H.

The complete near-diagonal ledger is

    spatial polar volume         r^(d-1) dr,
    height change s=b-k r^3       r^3 db dk,
    original observation density 12 r^(-(d+3)) pi_r(v_r),
    selected determinant weight  r^2 E_Qr[V_r sigma].

Their product is exactly `J r B_r dr db dk dvol(x) d sigma_x(u)`.
The dimensional powers cancel to r, since

    (d-1)+3-(d+3)+2=1.

The physical cubic gap alone is only one entry in this ledger.
In particular no exponent can be inferred while omitting the transformed
contact-density order or the determinant-product order.

Push forward ell=k r^3 at fixed k. For the very same representative (4),
its near part satisfies pointwise for ell>0

    ell^(1/3) nu_near(ell)
      =(1/(3 V_X)) integral_(SX,R,(0,infinity))
          1{k>=ell/r_0^3} k^(-2/3)
          J(x,(ell/k)^(1/3)u)
          B_((ell/k)^(1/3))(b,k,x,u)
          dvol(x) d sigma_x(u) db dk.

This can also be obtained by the substitution k=ell/r^3 directly in
(4)'s fixed-ell near integral, whose radial factor is J r^-2 B_r dr.
Thus it does not replace (4) merely by an almost-everywhere equal
representative before making a pointwise asymptotic claim.

For every fixed k>0 the radial point tends to zero. The indicator tends
to one, J tends to one, and the bounded-J version of k^-2/3 H is
integrable. Dominated convergence gives

    C=(4/V_X) integral_(SX,R,(0,infinity))
                    k^(-2/3) pi_0(v_0) z_0(b,k,x,u)
                    dvol(x) d sigma_x(u) db dk.             (14)

FAR supplies the entire remaining finite-bar contribution, because COUNT
already counts all bars once. Its scaled limit is zero. Hence
ell^(1/3) nu_bar(ell)->C. Positivity gives the equivalent asymptotic in
(1); integration uses integral_0^t ell^-1/3 d ell=(3/2)t^(2/3).
The cumulative statement is intrinsic to the expected measure.

Candidate domination makes this a finite Borel representative, but the
global selector need not be continuous in the conditional field. No
selected-density continuity is inherited from a continuous candidate
type-weight kernel. Arbitrary Radon-Nikodym representatives can be changed
on a null set and need not keep a pointwise asymptotic. Also, equality of
the selected and candidate contact coefficients gives only an
o(ell^-1/3) missed-near contribution; it gives no O(1) near remainder.

For a stationary flat-torus field, sigma is translation equivariant and
the midpoint integral cancels V_X. Directional dependence remains unless
an actual rotational symmetry is proved. On a manifold the x integral
in (14) remains; local laws can depend on x. The theorem is independent
of local coordinate choices, not independent of the law or metric in
its coefficient.

## 7. Centered Gaussian parity and the exact coefficient

The additional parity contract is that the Gaussian contact jets are
centered, their full U_0 covariance is positive definite, and the odd
block is independent of the even block:

    odd:  G=grad F (dimension d), T=F_uuu (one scalar);
    even: F, V=Hess F(u,.) (dimension d), A=Hess F|_(u-perp). (15)

Here V=(F_uu,F_uv_1,...,F_uv_(d-1)). It is the full axial column,
not the single entry F_uu. In Euclidean stationary real Gaussian fields,
covariance C(h)=C(-h) makes derivatives of odd total order vanish at
zero, proving this odd/even independence. Rotational isotropy is not
needed. On a general manifold an appropriate local parity symmetry or
the stated block-independence condition must actually be verified;
the word stationarity alone is not used to prove (15).

Let

    tau_(x,u)^2=Var(T|G=0)>0,
    D_(x,u)=E[(det A)^2 1{A<0} | V=0].                   (16)

All covariances are unconditional covariances of actual jets; (16) is
their actual Gaussian regression. CONTACT's limit can be written

    pi_0(v_0)=p_(F,V)(b,0) p_G(0) phi_tau(12k),
    z_0=36k^2 E[(det A)^2 1{A<0} | F=b,V=0].

The law of A conditioned on F=b,V=0 need not be centered. Integrating
birth first, with the true disintegration identity, gives

    integral_R p_(F,V)(b,0)
        E[(det A)^2 1{A<0} | F=b,V=0] db
      =p_V(0) D_(x,u).                                    (17)

This removes the F condition and retains every correlation between V and
A. Replacing V by F_uu, or centering the b-conditioned A, is incorrect.

The remaining scalar factor in (14) is

    144 integral_0^infinity k^(4/3) phi_tau(12k) dk
      =12^(-1/3) integral_0^infinity t^(4/3) phi_tau(t) dt
      =Gamma(7/6) tau^(4/3)/(24^(1/3) sqrt(pi)).            (18)

Indeed the last half-Gaussian moment is
2^(-1/3) Gamma(7/6) tau^(4/3)/sqrt(pi); multiplication by
12^(-1/3) gives the stated 24^(-1/3). Thus the Gaussian coefficient is

    C=Gamma(7/6)/(24^(1/3) sqrt(pi) V_X)
       *integral_SX p_G(0) p_V(0) tau_(x,u)^(4/3)
                                             D_(x,u)
                    dvol(x) d sigma_x(u).                  (19)

For a stationary flat torus, cancel the x volume. Ordinary sphere area
is used, not probability-normalized angular measure. The roles are
ordered maximum/merger, so there is no additional angular factor 1/2.

In d=2, A is a centered scalar under V=0, giving
D=Var(A|V=0)/2. In higher dimensions there is no such scalar half-variance
simplification: indefinite matrices also contribute to E(det A)^2, but
not to D. In d=1 A is empty, det A=1 and the negative-definite condition
is vacuous, so D=1. This algebra does not verify the separate circle
COUNT or contact-global SELECT adapter for a particular law.

Full U_0 covariance rank ensures p_G,p_V and tau exist and are positive.
It does not ensure D>0. For the centered conditional Gaussian A, D>0
exactly when its linear support meets the open negative-definite cone.
Full conditional covariance on Sym(u-perp) is a sufficient condition,
not a necessary one. For example a scalar Gaussian times the identity
has rank-one matrix support and positive D. Conversely, a trace-zero
two-by-two transverse support has no negative-definite matrix, so D=0
even if the separate U_0 rows have positive covariance. Such Gaussian
jet data can be realized locally by independent polynomial coefficients;
this is an algebraic counterexample to the inference from contact-row
rank alone, not an admission claim for a globally stationary model.

As unit checks, multiplying the field by a positive constant a scales
C by a^(-2/3). In (19), p_G p_V contributes a^(-2d), tau^(4/3)
contributes a^(4/3), and D contributes a^(2d-2). A spatial length
rescaling contributes length^(-d). Thus C has units
field^(-2/3) length^(-d), and C ell^(-1/3) has units
field^(-1) length^(-d), as a lifetime density per volume should.

## 8. A finite Gaussian sufficient adapter and its genuine boundary

Consider a fixed finite smooth linear Gaussian field F_xi with xi in R^N
standard Gaussian. This subsection proves conditional implications from
specified ranks; it does not prove the ranks or contact-global genericity
for every dimension or manifold.

Suppose the literal U_r matrix L_r extends continuously at r=0 and
L_0 has row rank 2d+2 for every x,u. On compact SX, its covariance has
a positive floor, and the same is true for all sufficiently small r.
The conditional coefficients at target v_r have the canonical realization

    xi_r=m_r+P_r Z,
    m_r=L_r^T (L_r L_r^T)^(-1) v_r,
    P_r=I-L_r^T (L_r L_r^T)^(-1) L_r,                     (20)

where Z is a standard Gaussian vector. P_r is an orthogonal projector,
not a full-rank residual covariance requirement. This coupling is continuous
in actual coefficients. It gives global C4 convergence at each fixed mark,
and on compact marks ||F_r||Cq<=C(1+||Z||) for each fixed q. Thus it
supplies the conditional moment and uniform-integrability part of CONTACT.
The Gaussian densities also converge at the actual targets, supplying
its density part. SELECT still needs the contact-global genericity premise
on positive limiting weight, supplied to the deterministic result in
Section 4. Row rank alone does not prove that nonlocal premise.

For all marks, the covariance floor gives conditional mean norm at most
C(|b|+k) and centered covariance at most I. Finite-dimensional norm
equivalence gives ||F||Cq<=C_q||xi||. The exact zero-gradient endpoint
averages and (11) give

    |det H_i|/r<=C(1+||F||C3)^d,
    W_r/r^2<=C(1+||F||C3)^(2d).                          (21)

The polynomial degree is 2d, not the dimension-two degree four.
For d>=2 the two terms in (11) have degrees d and d in Hessian/third
derivative bounds after allowing r<=1; d=1 is the axial bound alone.
The target (7) is uniformly coercive in (b,k): its first and fourth
coordinates are b-k r^3/2 and 12k, so |v_r|^2>=c(b^2+k^2).
Uniform upper and lower covariance bounds then yield

    12 pi_r(v_r) E_Qr[V_r]
      <=C(1+|b|+k)^(2d) exp[-c(b^2+k^2)].                (22)

This is an unnormalized all-mark envelope. Its product with k^-2/3
is integrable for every finite d. No inverse random curvature or
global inverse normalizer is used. It supplies ENVELOPE from the stated
finite Gaussian contact rank and smooth finite basis.

For COUNT and FAR, suppose in addition the original value/gradient
observations at every distinct pair have rank 2d+2. On each compact
annulus away from the diagonal their covariance has a positive floor.
The point-gradient incidence gives unconditional Morse genericity without
a Morse-to-Rice cycle: choose d invertible coefficient columns locally,
write the zero-gradient coefficients as a smooth function of the point
and remaining coefficients, and project that N-dimensional incidence
chart to R^N. Its derivative is singular precisely when the physical
Hessian is singular. Equal-dimensional smooth Sard makes the critical
values null. A countable minor/chart cover proves almost sure Morse.

Similarly, the pair-gradient incidence uses 2d invertible coefficient
columns. In local orthonormal/coordinate charts, the determinant of its
coefficient projection contains |det H_p det H_q| divided by the chosen
coefficient minor. The equal-dimensional weighted area formula, followed
by coefficient change of variables and a countable disjoint partition
of minor charts, gives (3) for all nonnegative Borel marks, initially
possibly infinite. Start with that extended identity; no finiteness or
Morse conclusion is assumed to justify it. On compact annuli, the
covariance floor and finite conditional determinant moments make the
unmarked integral finite. No arbitrary-jet rank is used.

The conditional two-height covariance is positive by the original
2d+2 row rank. The tie indicator F(p)=F(q) has zero contribution after
height disintegration on each annulus. Countable annulus exhaustion
and (3) give distinct critical values almost surely. Point Morse
genericity already gave a finite critical set on compact X. This supplies
the unconditional genericity and the Borel H0 count portion of COUNT.

At separation>=r_0, the same original covariance floor and conditional
determinant moment bound give the candidate density estimate

    integral_R p_O(b,0,b-ell,0) E_Q[W] db <=C,
                                          0<ell<=1.       (23)

Gaussian density supplies exp(-c b^2) and conditional determinant
moments a polynomial in |b| for this bounded ell band. Compact spatial
integration is harmless. The selected kernel is bounded by this candidate
kernel, so FAR follows. For any fixed compact positive-lifetime interval
the same argument gives a finite local bound. These are direct density
estimates, not derivatives of cumulative counts.

The classical imports here are equal-dimensional smooth Sard and the
weighted Euclidean area formula (with coordinate volume factors). C below
records the previous primary AAL/E2 comparisons and classical-source
exposure. This preparation spells out how they are used but does not
reprove those classical theorems or claim a new primary-book read.

The genuinely model-dependent remaining checks in this sufficient adapter
are actual two-site/contact ranks, negative-cone positivity, and the
contact-global genericity needed on positive weight. A smooth basis and
covariance continuity do not discharge them. For a finite collection of
already verified models one may take finite minima and maxima of constants.
No uniformity over a spectrum approaching degeneracy, unbounded cutoff,
variable geometry or an arbitrary infinite-dimensional field follows.

## 9. Why covariance, even with moments and Morse topology, is insufficient

There are two exact obstructions to a covariance-only universality claim.

First take a smooth finite Gaussian Fourier family whose generic coefficient
vectors give Morse fields with distinct critical values. Choose an
orthonormal basis v_1,...,v_N of coefficient space all of whose signed
directions give such generic fields. Such a basis exists: Haar-almost every
orthogonal basis has generic columns, because each column is uniform on
the coefficient sphere and the genericity exceptions have measure zero.
One may also choose a column in the nonempty open set of fields with
multiple local maxima, by starting near a small generic perturbation of
cos(2x)+cos(2y) in a family containing those modes. Then let xi take the
2N values +-sqrt(N) v_j with equal probabilities. It has mean zero and
covariance I, and every atom is Morse with distinct critical values.
Every covariance of field jets matches that of the Gaussian family.
Nevertheless its expected finite lifetime measure is a nonzero finite
atomic measure, not a Lebesgue density with a `-1/3` contact asymptotic.
This already falsifies the inference from covariance/rank alone.

The following obstruction also retains continuous amplitude variation and
all positive smooth-norm moments. Let H be any of the sourced finite
Gaussian fields with a positive finite-bar coefficient, and independently
let S in (0,1) have distribution P(S<=s)=s^alpha, 0<alpha<2/3. Put

    R=S/sqrt(E S^2), F=R H, E S^2=alpha/(alpha+2).

Then E R^2=1, so F has exactly H's covariance. R is strictly positive
and bounded, all positive Cq moments remain finite, and every realization
has the same Morse topology and elder pairing as H, with all lifetimes
multiplied by R. Let 0<a<b be such that E N_H([a,b])>0; such an interval
exists because H's expected finite-bar measure is nonzero. For sufficiently
small t,

    E N_F((0,t])
      >=E N_H([a,b]) P(R<=t/b)
      =c t^alpha, c>0.                                   (24)

Since alpha<2/3, the ratio to t^(2/3) diverges. A finite positive coefficient
in (1) is impossible. This is a lower-bound falsifier, not a proof of an
alternative alpha density law. The small-amplitude boundary is not
controlled by covariance or positive moments. Indeed E R^(-2/3) is
infinite, matching the amplitude-scaling diagnostic C_(aH)=a^-2/3 C_H.
Some of the structural regularity/domination interfaces must therefore
fail for this mixture. No covariance-only Gaussian coefficient formula
can be transferred to this non-Gaussian law.

For a non-Gaussian law which actually meets the five interfaces, (14) is
still the coefficient. It involves the actual contact density and actual
conditional transverse weight, with all-mark integrability. Odd/even
uncorrelatedness is not independence outside the Gaussian setting, and
does not justify the factorization (17)-(19).

## 10. Conditional order taxonomy; no unproved higher-singularity class law

There is a useful general scaling test, which is an algebraic pushforward
lemma under its stated analytic domination, not a higher-order field theorem.
Suppose a particular admitted local family has lifetime ell=k r^m, m>0,
radial volume r^gamma dr, height Jacobian r^m, original observation density
order r^-a, and determinant/selected weight order r^w. Suppose its remaining
joint amplitude B_r converges to B_0 and has an integrable majorant for the
substitution below. The joint radial power is

    s=gamma+m-a+w,
    r^s B_r dr db dk d(other parameters).

The pushforward has exponent

    e=(s+1)/m-1=(gamma+1-a+w)/m,

and coefficient

    (1/m) integral k^(-(s+1)/m) B_0 db dk d(other parameters). (25)

The appropriate k-weighted majorant and negligible complement have to be
proved for that family. In ordinary spatial dimension d, gamma=d-1,
so e=(d-a+w)/m. The regular cubic contract has m=3, a=d+3 and w=2,
giving s=1 and e=-1/3. The cubic order by itself supplies only m.

The following changes are therefore falsifiable failures of admission,
or possible different regimes only after new proofs:

* If a contact density acquires an extra radial singularity or vanishing
  factor, a changes. Covariance rank is a direct diagnostic but not a
  substitute for the actual density asymptotic.
* If the transverse block has a forced extra null direction, the physical
  determinant order can change, or the maximum cone can have zero weight.
  One cannot keep (12) with a positive coefficient without checking it.
* If the axial contact has higher order, m and usually the observation and
  determinant orders change together. Merely substituting a new m while
  keeping the cubic a,w is not a derived higher-order universality law.
  The strict convexity of the reduced derivative used for elder transfer
  can fail; additional local critical points may occur.
* If geometry or support supplies a different radial order gamma, the
  dimension cancellation must be recomputed. A smooth manifold's leading
  metric Jacobian is regular, so ordinary curvature alone does not change
  gamma=d-1 in this theorem.
* If selected probability has a nontrivial limiting loss, its actual
  selected contact weight replaces z_0; a vanishing selection order can
  change w. Candidate counting cannot decide that input.
* If a far contribution or noncompact-mark tail dominates, the contact
  calculation does not determine the total small-lifetime asymptotic.
  Equation (24) is an explicit such boundary failure.

For s>-1 the local cumulative power predicted by (25) is (s+1)/m.
For s<=-1 a strictly positive limiting coefficient would be nonintegrable
at zero, incompatible with a finite expected short-bar count. This is a
consistency test, not an assurance that a proposed singularity is realized.
Even within the regular fold class, varying a spectrum changes the local
jet coefficient; constants need not be uniform near spectral degeneracy.
The proven toy-control lesson that radial/contact weight matters is exactly
what (25) retains, instead of identifying a cubic gap with a complete law.

The sourced finite Gaussian chain supplies actual two-dimensional ideal-law
adapters at each fixed positive full-square spectrum,K>=2,L>0. The twenty fixed
catalogue Gaussian cases retain individual coefficients and qualitative
finite-family uniformity; they are not independent empirical confirmations or
sampler certificates. General dimensions, manifolds and non-Gaussian fields
still require the actual five interfaces and positive cone coefficient. The
separate infinite periodized Gaussian proof is one specific completed analytic
adapter, not an automatic admission rule for arbitrary laws.

Higher homology, spatial expanding-domain processes, numerical windows, certified
computational coupling, blind-field validation, publication uptake and critical
Lean discharge remain separate. No source-status or governance record is promoted.
